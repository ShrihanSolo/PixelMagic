            For parts 1 and 2 it was straightforward as we had to implement the de Casteljau algorithm. For one we just performed
            a step of the algorithm and for two we extended that by performing the recursion for an entire matrix of control points.
            For part 3 we implemented the area-weighted normal function for Phong shading that made our images smoother by looping
            over all the triangles neighboring a point, taking each of their normal vector using the getNormal function and then using
            these normals for the final computation (which was just the sum of normals divided by the sum of the normal magnitudes). For
            part 4 and 5 we just followed the HalfEdgeMesh Operations guide by drawing diagrams for our mesh elements before and after
            edge splits and flips and we just stored and reassigned our mesh elements accordingly and it worked. For part 6 we followed
            the steps as provided, looped over edges and vertices when needed and used the flips and splits and new position computations
            to get our subdivisions.

            Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
        </b>
        <p>
            The de Casteljau algorithm recursively evaluates bezier curves where in each step it performs
            linear interpolation between every pair of points using a given parameter t. So to implement
            one step of the algorithm for a 2D Bezier curve we just wrote a for-loop that looks at every pair
            of points and evaluates new points using each such pair, linear interpolation and the parameter 't',
            hence evaluating one less point than the number of control points in the previous step.

        <b>
            Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
        </b>
        <p>
            As we move from Bezier curves in 2D to Bezier surfaces in 3D, two key things change about the de Casteljau
            algorithm: firstly, instead of a single parameter 't' we use two parameters 'u' and 'v', and secondly, we
            evaluate a single point from a matrix of points and not an array of points. So first we implemented evaluateStep
            which just performed the same thing as evaluateStep as before but for 3D instead of 2D points, then we implemented
            evaluate1D which perform all the steps (n*(n-1)/2 steps) of the algorithm for an array of say 'n' control points
            and so all we did was perform evaluateStep for the entire array a total of (n-1) times, and finally, we implemented
            evaluate which basically performed the whole algorithm for the 3D surface and all we did was perform evaluate1D for each
            horizontal row using the first parameter 'u' and then then perform evaluate1D for the resulting vertical column of points
            using the second parameter 'v' hence giving us a single point for the entire matrix in the end.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

        <b>
            Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
        </b>
        <p>
            For this problem we had to implement the function 'normal' which took a vertex and took the area-weighted average
            of the normal vectors of the neighboring triangles of said vertex. So we wrote a loop that traversed every
            next half edge starting from our initial vertex and for every three half edges would go to the twin instead of the
            next half edge and ended once we came back to this vertex. For every three half
            edges we'd get a triangle and so we used the 'getNormal' function that computes the normal vector to a triangle
            from its three vertices. This loop then gives us the normal vector to every neighboring triangle for a vertex. Then
            we use these normals to take the area-weighted mean of these normals which, using the fact that Area = ||Nomral||/2 and
            with some simplification, turns out to be the sum of the normals divided by the sum of the magnitudes of the normals.

            Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.

        <p>
            For the edge flip operation, we used the "Guide to Implementing Edge Operations on a Half-Edge Data Structure" provided in
            the spec. We first constructed two diagrams on a whiteboard- one with two triangles sharing an edge and one with the same
            shapes but where the edge has been flipped. We then labelled every half-edge, edge, vertex and face in either diagram with
            variable names like h0, h1,..., h9 and e0, e1, ..., e4 and v0, v1, v2, v3 and f0, f1. We then noticed the changes and we implemented
            flipEdge as follows: we "collect" our mesh elements required, that is, store them in variables, and then "reassign" mesh elements,
            that is, store again and change pointers accordingly so our edge has actually been flipped.

        <p>
            We initially made a tiny mistake as to which half-edge and which edge changes to which, but with careful labelling it was
            solved very quickly and we didn't have to do any debugging as the flipping process is relatively straightforward.

        <p>
            For the edge split operation, our process was very similar to the edge flip, where we used the "Guide to Implementing Edge

            two triangles sharing an edge and one with the same shapes but where the edge has been split into two. We then labelled
            every half-edge, edge, vertex and face in either diagram. This time the number of mesh elements we had to keep track of were way more
            such as instead of 10 half edges we had 16 half edges in the second diagram, especially since instead of one edge we had four edges and we
            had an entirely new vertex. We then noticed the changes and we implemented splitEdge as follows: we "collect" our mesh elements required
            and then "reassign" the mesh elements.

        <p>
            Our process was pretty much the same, and since we were extremely careful with labelling the mesh elements
            we did not make any mistakes there. The only difference was instead of returning the flipped edge like last time
            we return the new vertex as a result of the split edge and so we did return the new vertex (v4) but forgot to
            write what its position should be (the mean of 4 vertex positions) and so it was defaulting to the origin, hence
            making our faces point inward after any edge split. Once we realized the silly error, we fixed it and everything worked.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
        <b>
            Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
        </b>
        <p>
            We implemented loop subdivision under our mesh upsampler function. We started by computing new positions for all the vertices in the input mesh,
            using the Loop subdivision rule and storing them in Vertex::newPosition. For this we iterated over every vertex in the
            mesh, computed neighbor position sums using the centroid function and used the given formula for newPosition. At this point, we also want to mark
            each vertex as being a vertex of the original mesh so for each vertex we marked isNew as false. Then we computed the updated vertex positions
            associated with edges, and store it in Edge::newPosition. For this we just iterated over every edge and found the ends of the
            edge and the ends of the splitting edge and used these vertex positions to compute newPosition. During this loop we had maintained a counter
            that counted the number of edges before any splits. We then split every edge in the mesh, in any order. For this iterated over the edges but stopped looping once our previous counter for number of edges ended so that
            we wouldn't iterate over any new edges as a result of splits. For this step, we marked every edge of every triangle as new or old as we went along our splits. Then,
            we iterated over every edge, but for any edge that was new and exactly one of its end vertices was new (so the other was old), we would flip such an edge.
            Finally we iterated over all vertices and for old vertices (isNew = false) we changed position to newPosition since this would now be the position of the vertex
            after the subdivisions are done.

            Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?

        <p>
            As seen below in the file for the cow, as the loop subdivisions increase, the triangle mesh gets subdivided into smaller triangles
            causing the resolution to increase and the surface to look more defined. Although initially it seems like the subdivisions are increasing
            the number of sharp corners and edges, with more and more subdivisions, since the the number of sharp corners have been multiplied many-fold,
            the surface is starting to look smoother.

            Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.
